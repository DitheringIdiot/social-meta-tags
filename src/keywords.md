# Meta Keywords

<p class="lead"><span>Leave the keywords meta tag in the 90s.</span></p>

`Keywords` was once one of the most popular `<meta>` tag on the internet.[^1] 

Search engines used keywords to help rank pages — but that relied on people being honest.

It didn't take long for the kewords `<meta>` tag to be misused — stuffed with duplicate or unrelated keywords in an attempt to trick search engines.

Here's an example of `austinpowers.com` presumably trying to get traffic from people searching *comedy*, *Batman*, and even *cryogenics*.

Search engines do not use `keywords` as a ranking factor anymore.[^2] 

Some websites still use the `keywords` `<meta>` tag for internal use. But that's their business.
