## What is this for?

You know when you paste a url on social media or in a messenger app? How it sometimes generates a preview?

Well that doesn't happen all by itself. You need to add tags to the `<head>` of your `html` for it to work.

Different apps have different methods of parsing the data on your site to create a preview â€” there's no consensus on which method to use. 

The result of this is websites adopting some or **all** the possible tags. It's a mess. 

The only users of these tags are robots that crawl your site. Everyone else has to download them for no reason.
